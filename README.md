# About

This project was built using `React`, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
The website was designed by breaking down the different parts of the page into reusable `components`. 
Each component focuses on a specific functionality or section, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

The `useEffect` hooks in React is used to handle any necessary side effects within these components. 
Additionally, the `AOS(Animate On Scroll)` library of CSS is incorporated to add captivating scrolling effects to enhance the user experience. 


# Deployment

The website was deployed using `Netlify`
